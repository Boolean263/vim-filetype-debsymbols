# vim-filetype-symbols

This is a fairly simple syntax file for vim.
It's meant to make it easier to work with the Debian symbols files
generated by `dpkg-gensymbols` and used when packaging `.deb` packages.

It could probably be improved,
which is why I'm publishing it here for all interested parties,
but as written it currently meets my needs.

## Installation

I recommend using a vim plugin manager.
I personally use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

If you want to install it manually,
copy the files from this repo into the equivalent directories in your `~/.vim` directory
(eg, `ftdetect/deb-symbols.vim` to `~/.vim/ftdetect/deb-symbols.vim`).

## Usage

No special steps should be necessary.
It should detect files named `symbols` and `*.symbols` and apply the highlighting.
If you aren't experiencing this, you can try the vim command `:set filetype=deb-symbols`.

## Future Improvements

* Add support for alternative dependency templates.
* Add support for field names and values in `* field-name: field-value` format.
